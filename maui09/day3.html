Day 3

- gray morning; one sudden and significant downpour
- got ready and headed out towards the beach, got a clear view of the other side of the island from the overlookfor the first time
- , stopped by VegOut on the way (note: Google maps does not work that well on the island), muffelata sandwich (olive spread, breaded tofu, only "bad" part was the bread) and falafel wrap (with messy but delicious sauce)
- headed down to Maleka? state park, only a bit of unforunately navigation
- walked most of the way down he beach, set up towels near the dark rocky area
- little scared of jellyfish and riptide, but ended up getting in the water and swimming around twice, second time with the underwater camera
- tired walk back down the breach, drove back to the cottage, really glad for a shower
- got a little sunburned :-P
- headed out for dinner (in my new dress!), tried Abundant Aina but barely found them and they were closed "for a few weeks", ended up at Bangkok Cuisine, perfectly good Thai food (cashew nut basil tofu, Evil prince)
- stopped at Down to Earth, got sweet and sara vegan marshmallows and chocolate covered ginger as well as breakfast stuff and aloe for the burns
- headed home, looked at the crazy distored/blacked out underwater photos (and a few goods ones)
- early tobed to be ready for snorkling tomorrrow
