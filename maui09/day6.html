Day 6

- lazy morning
- leftover grilled veggies/pineapple
- headed over to the Hawaii Nature center; closed at first, opened as we drove away; came back and signed up for a guided hike
- we were the only ones on the hike; nice guy who's lived on Hawaii all his life; crossed stream on a big pipe/bridge; wild areas plus managed land; taro planting areas; coffee beans and thimble berry
- visited museum, definitely more for kids (and not the highest quality even then)
- Iao Needle park; paved trails, hiked all available lengths, including up to the top vantage point
- headed down to Shangr'la By The Sea but chickened out when we discovered it was in a hotel
- went back to Paia, had dinner at Flatbread (this time with peppers and olives added)
- followed up with Ono Gelato, guava and strawberry flavors in a shared cup (half vegan display, half dairly, biodegradable cups/spoons)
- headed back for a quiet evening, had a little lizard/newt-based excitement
