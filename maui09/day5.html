Day 5

- lazy morning at the cottage, laundry, etc.
- Evan grilled veggies, tempeh, and pineapple in Annie's Natural's island sauce, was delicious
- got packed up and headed along Hana highway towards Hana/other side of Haleakala National Park
- turned out to be an impossibly windy, narrow road with a huge number of one lane bridges and blind turns!  Emily was nervous, even though Evan did an excellent job driving
- *finally* got to the park, took a hike around to see the falls (swimming in the pools was closed, which was okay since it was cold and we were tired)
- on the way up to the upper falls overlook, it started to pour with rain and we got quite wet
- headed back down and drove out of the park the opposite direction of the way we came in
- less windy, but bumpy dirt road/heavily patched road and not two proper lanes for many miles
- lots of pretty amazing views, cows with white companion birds
- stopped at a black rock beach for a few photos
- got back to Makawao, had dinner at Veg Out (creamy broccoli soup, taro burger which wasn't what we expected, hot italian sandwich)
- back to the cottage and collapsed
