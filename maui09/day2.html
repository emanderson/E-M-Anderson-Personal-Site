Day 2

- leisurely morning, nice views, called both sets of parents
- got S&J to guess where we were, Dad got it and Mom was completely surprised and sure we were in NYC, need to take bird pics
- Emily didn't realize L&S were on video-chat, walked through with little on (but fortunately they only saw the head towel!), want to borrow the underwater camera for their upcoming trip
- packed up a lunch (fruit, bread, energy bars) and got in the Beetle to head to Halekalu?? National Park
- Google Maps lied to us!  led up a dead end road (locked gate at the end)
- National Parks directions got us back on track, sideways rain, variable drippiness meant exciting driving
- headed up to the summit, very foggy
- $10 for three days access, quite a good deal
- stopped near the top and took a short (~30 minutes) hike, momentary clearing then pouring right back in of fog, multicolored, pitted rocks, cold + wet = unusual glasses/arm hairs/etc.
- drove up to summit, observatories, clouds all around, above the clouds
- back down Evan drove, less fog + faster turns
- lazy afternoon
- Flatbread Pizza for dinner, delicious salad (miso-pineapple dressing?  seasame seeds, arame seaweed, carrot, celery (even Evan liked), lettuce), sweet ale, explicitly vegan flatbread pizza with good tomato sauce, tomatoes, avocado, pineapple (we added), carmelized onions, mushrooms, waiter tried to sell dessert but turned out to all not be vegan (he went and asked and was really nice about it)
- back to the cottage for a leisurely evening
